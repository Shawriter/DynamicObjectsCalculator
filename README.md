This is a base project CMS for calculating animals/weather/objects in nature and learning about their behavior, decided to start with an animal theme. The squirrel moves when the mouse touches it, so it is not bugging out. Future use case is to set these objects in a defined space with a learned behavior to see how the system evolves. Users can add content and will be able to plot charts in the future based on object recognition and environment, to study dynamic systems.
